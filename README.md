VilTAGE
=======

Stands for *ViliX'S Text/ASCII Game Engine*. It's more of a framework than a game engine.

In the future, VilTAGE should be able to provide an easy way of making an ASCII based games.

That includes:

- Rendering & update loops
- Entity system
- Input
- Stages
- CSS manipulation of game objects
