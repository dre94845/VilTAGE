Stands for **ViliX's Text/ASCII Game Engine**. It's more of a framework than a game engine.

In the future, VilTAGE should be able to provide an easy way of making Dart ASCII based games.

### Getting Started



### Documentation

VilTAGE is too small by this time, so no Wiki is necessary. This can change in the future.

### Contact

You can contact me on Twitter @ViliX64 where I'll happily explain everything about VilTAGE to you.

### Contributing & Source

The author of VilTAGE is Vil√©m Zouhar (ViliX64). I'm constantly improving the code base. Reporting any issues/suggesting new things is the best way how to improve VilTAGE. You can also change the code itself and commit changes!

### License

VilTAGE is licensed under the MIT License, meaning you can use it/change as long as you mention at least somewhere in the description that your game uses VilTAGE.
